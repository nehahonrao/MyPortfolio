## Porfolio With React

### Day 1:
- I decided to make my portfolio with the help of ReactJS.
- Created  react app "npx create-react-app porfolio"
- run "cd porfolio" this command to move to the porfolio directory
- to run react application run this command "npm start" 
- A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! If not, open your browser and type localhost:3000 in the address bar.
- In src folder there is app.js file,whatever changes you made in this     file are visible on browser
